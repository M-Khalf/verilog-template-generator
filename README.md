# verilog-template-generator
A Python-based tool designed to simplify the creation of Verilog designs and testbenches. By answering a series of straightforward questions, users can generate customizable, syntax error-free Verilog templates for both sequential and combinational designs, along with their corresponding testbenches.

## Features

- **Automated Code Generation**: Automatically generate Verilog templates for sequential and combinational designs.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Choose the number of inputs and outputs, as well as design parameters.
- **Testbench Creation**: Generate testbenches with user-defined test cases.
- **Syntax Error-Free**: The tool ensures that all generated code is syntax-error free, reducing manual debugging time.
- **Supports Sequential and Combinational Designs**: Select the design type based on your needs.

## Installation

To install **VeriGen**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verilog-template-generator.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd verilog-template-generator

3. **Install dependencies:** If you don't already have Python 3 installed, please install it. This tool only requires Python, and no additional dependencies are needed beyond Python itself.

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   To start using verilog-template-generator, run the main Python script from the command line:
   python verigen.py
   
2. **Answer the prompts:**
   The script will ask you a series of questions to define your Verilog design


3. **Code Generation:**:
   Once you've answered the questions, verilog-template-generator will automatically generate.

3. **Customization:**:
   The generated Verilog templates can be further customized to meet specific project requirements.

## Example

Once you run the script, here's an example of what the generated files might look like:

1. **Verilog Design (design.v): For a sequential design, the generated Verilog code could look like this:**:



2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd verilog-template-generator
